Hand-in 1 (by Feb 25, 16:59): Hand-in your project as git repository, including a README.md file. The repository should contain at least 3 HTML pages which are linked to each other. They must be styled using a variety of CSS rules (without framework). All pages should be responsive, using media queries and at least 2 breakpoints.


üìù Hand-in 2/4 (Backend & Routing) by Mar 11, 16:59!: Hand-in your project containing a web backend with at least 3 different routes. At least one route should be dynamic, allowing users to access many different pages with different URLs handled by a single route function in the backend.

This project is a website for Royal Spirit, a company specializing in alcoholic beverages. The purpose of this project is to showcase the company's products, provide information about events, and engage with the community.

Current
6 pages
Homepage
4 product pages
1 community page that intends to display events and social media content


rn you can only access my dynamic routes using http://localhost:3000/use idk if you can open that but yeah.
These pages are use, ful, les and ed ejs (files)
## styles
Substyles css refers to specific code related to the product pages.
Navvy refers to css specific for the navigation bar.

I have also created some templates for the navigation and waiting list.


## Work in Progress

The following features are currently under development:
- Waiting list functionality
- Search bar functionality
Tho both of these are forms that handle user data.

I am working on a carousel which sort of works but still need to make the items clickable
